Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice using Python libraries. 
The goal is to understand the dataset's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers, and to visualize the findings using various plots. This analysis serves as a foundation for further data processing or modeling.

Objective
To explore and analyze the dataset to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and relationships.
To visualize the data to facilitate a deeper understanding and to communicate insights effectively.

Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Numpy: For numerical operations and statistical analysis.
Matplotlib: For basic plotting and visualization.
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations.

Data Loading:
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Explored the structure and basic statistics of the data.
Data Cleaning:
Identified and handled missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored data distributions using histograms.
Analyzed relationships between variables with scatter plots.

Visualization:
Created histograms to visualize distributions.
Used scatter plots to identify relationships between continuous variables.
